# pyAutoRef
This is the python version of the
"Automated reference tissue normalization of T2-weighted MR images of the prostate using object recognition"

This is an automated method for dual-reference tissue (fat and muscle) normalization of T2-weighted MRI for the prostate.

The method was developed at the CIMORe group at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway.

For detailed information about this method, please read our paper: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10334-020-00871-3]

# Installation
You can install the package either from pip or using pip or the files in GitHub repository [https://github.com/MohammedSunoqrot/pyAutoRef]

## pip
Simply type:
```
pip install pyAutoRef
```
## GitHub
- Clone the GitHub repository
  
   *From command line*
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedSunoqrot/pyAutoRef.git
   ```
- Change directory to the clones folder (unzip if needed) and type
   ```
   pip install . 
   ```

# Difference Note
This python version is differ than the originally published MATLAB version [https://github.com/ntnu-mr-cancer/AutoRef] in terms:
- It accepts all kind of SimpleITK supported image format.
- It uses YOLOv8 model for object detector instead of ACF.
   (This model is trained using the same data and bounding boxes used to train ACF in the original/MATLAB code).

# How to use pyAutoRef
To perform AutoRef normalization, you first need to import the `autoref` function.
You can do it by calling `from pyAutoRef import autoref`

## `autoref` Function 
   - Parameters:
        input_image_path (str): The file path to the input 3D image (any supported SimpleITK format) or to the DICOM folder.
        output_image_path (str, optional): The file path to save the normalized output image to any supported SimpleITK format.
                                           If None, the image will not be saved.

   - Returns:
        normalized_image (SimpleITK.Image): The normalized 3D image.

## Supported input/output formats
- DICOM Series.
- All the medical [images formats supported by SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io/en/v2.2.0/IO.html).
- [SimpleITK.Image] (https://simpleitk.org/SimpleITK-Notebooks/01_Image_Basics.html).

***DICOM Series is recognized when there is no file extension***

### Examples of usage:

***Example (input: medical image format, output: medical image format):***
```
from pyAutoRef import autoref

input_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2.nii.gz"
output_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2_normalized.nii.gz"

autoref(input_image_path, output_image_path)
```

***Example (input: medical image format, output: DICOM Series):***
```
from pyAutoRef import autoref

input_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2.nii.gz"
output_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2_normalized"

autoref(input_image_path, output_image_path)
```

***Example (input: DICOM Series, output: medical image format):***
```
from pyAutoRef import autoref

input_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2"
output_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2_normalized.nii.gz"

autoref(input_image_path, output_image_path)

```
***Example (input: DICOM Series, output: DICOM Series):***
```
from pyAutoRef import autoref

input_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2"
output_image_path = r"C:\Data\Case10_t2_normalized"

autoref(input_image_path, output_image_path)
```
